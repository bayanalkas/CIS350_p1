# CIS350_p1
# SortedArray.cpp Skeleton

This is a skeleton C++ program that provides a template for a sorted array implementation using templates. It includes various methods to manipulate and work with a sorted array.

## Overview

This C++ program provides a skeleton for implementing a sorted array using templates. It includes the following features:

- Default constructor
- Copy constructor
- Destructor
- Overloaded assignment operator
- Accessor operator []
- Checking if two sorted arrays are the same
- Checking if the array is empty
- Getting the size and capacity of the array
- Reserving capacity
- Printing elements of the array
- Clearing the array of elements
- Inserting an element into the sorted array
- Removing the minimum element
- Deleting the maximum element
- Finding the minimum and maximum elements
- Binary search for an element in the sorted array

## Usage

You can use this skeleton code as a starting point for implementing your own sorted array class with additional functionality. You can add more methods and customize it according to your specific requirements.

# SortedArray.h

## Description

`SortedArray.h` defines the class template `SortedArray<Object>`. This header file provides a template for implementing a sorted array data structure in C++.

## Class Overview

The `SortedArray<Object>` class template provides the following functionality:

- Default constructor
- Copy constructor
- Destructor
- Overloaded assignment operator
- Accessor Operator `[]`
- Checking if two sorted arrays are the same
- Checking if the array is empty
- Getting the size and capacity of the array
- Reserving capacity
- Displaying elements of the array
- Clearing the array of elements
- Inserting an element into the sorted array
- Removing the minimum element
- Deleting the maximum element
- Finding the minimum and maximum elements
- Binary search for an element in the sorted array

## Usage
You can include this header file in your C++ program to create and manipulate sorted arrays of objects. To use this header file, include it in your C++ source code as follows:
#include "SortedArray.h"
